# COVID-19-Portfolio-Project
This is a data analytics project I did for my portfolio with SQL. 
I have arranged the code in paragraphs for easier interaction. 
To see what each paragraph does, simply highlight it and execute the code
Some paragraphs have a 'create view function to create new views. For these, first run the paragraphs without the 'create view... as' lines to see the results. Once satisfied, you may run the entire pargraph to create the view which will be used later on in a following project.
Should you have any suggestions, questions or anything to communicate feel free to reach out in the comments
THANK YOU
